Performance wise there is probably not a huge\nhit since we are parsing relatively small amounts of text.\nSee issue #487.",

I don't know if it's related to this commit, or its another issue.\nFixes #615.",

I'm fairly confident it works, but I wouldn't be surprised if it breaks in places since spoilers are consistent between subreddits.\n+++ COMMIT MESSAGE +++\nThis has been tested on subreddits that use\n\n#s\n/s\n/sp\n/spoiler\n\nas spoiler identifiers. The effect is that the visible text is\ndisplayed as a link, with a whitespace, then the spoiler text\nblacked out. When the visible text the clicked, the text of the\nspoiler text is reset to white, with the backgroud to stay black.\nThis is a bit fragile due to the fact that:\n\nsubreddits use different hrefs for spoiler tags,\nthe visible spoiler text is different per subreddit (and even\nper post).\n\nAccordingly, there are a few assumptions. Firstly:\nA1. Spoilers are identified by the presence of the \"title\" attribute\nwithin the  tag.\nThis seems consitent with the html that comes out of reddit, and\nis used in the regex to find each spoiler.\nA2. The text within the spoiler does not end in \"]]\".\nThe whole parsing token is \"]s]]\", but this is relaxed to just \"]]\"\nsince it may or may not happen. Should probably be strengthed in\nthe future.\nA3. If the title attribue is empty, insert \"spoiler\" as the visible\ntext.\nThis is fairly self-explanatory, since having no title will mean\nthere is nothing to click on.\nIf more patterns need to be added to identify spoilers, see\nImageType.getImageType(String url).\nTo prevent collapsing of the children tree when a spoiler link is pressed,\nActiveTextView.spoilerClicked is set to true and is checked in the onClick\nfunction in CommentAdapter for the R.id.content element.\nSome amount of code clean up was added, since there were a lot of\ninconsitent spacing issues and a few indents which could be reduced\nby re-wording if statements.\nFixes #692, #691",

            "bodyText": "This was more involved than I though it would be, but I think the end result is less complicated than the diff would show.\nEssentially, SubredditPosts.LoadData#onPostExecute was refactored where view specific logic was moved to the SubmissionsDisplay interface. The fragments that need to be updated when more comments are loaded can implement their logic using this interface, which leaves SubredditPosts view agnostic. This allows fragments such as CommentsScreen and SubmissionView to both utilize this class, despite having different requirements.\nIn addition, when swiping through posts the comments async task is cancelled. Otherwise if you swipe rapidly, and a lot of the tasks are executed and you have to wait a long time for all the previous posts to be loaded.\nThere was a fair amount of code clean up too, but original logic should be intact.\nI probably don't have time for this, but the next step I was going to take was make SubredditPost/MultiredditPost have private constructors, and use a factory to manage each subreddit. This would remove the need for DataShare.sharedSubreddits as its nasty.\nFixes #478, and allows #753 to be fixed pretty easily. Mildly related to #800",

I think most of the work will be refactoring the views, and fix possible issues where MakeTextviewClickable was used. Maybe it would be good if this were merged into a separate branch?\nThis started off as a pull request to display tables, but this has since turned into much more of a refactor due to performance issues.\nIt looks like the scrolling performance of every list view can be fixed to reducing the nested Linear/Relative layouts in the xml. The diff in comment.xml is an example of this flattening, and it's really been the biggest factor in speeding up scrolling.\nMakeTextviewClickable has also been removed, since a new instance is created on every onBindViewHolder call which is really unnecessary and had some funny logic. In doing so I've ripped out and bunch of code of with the old references and replaced it with new code that may or may not work. The most complete example is in CommentAdapter.setViews.\nCurrent features are\n\nhorizontal scrolling code blocks\ntables\nincreased comment scrolling performance\n\nI aim to solve the following (at least) with this pull:\n\n#934 done\n#440 not started\n#682 not started\ncomment scrolling performance\nsubreddit scrolling performance",

Great job at making the layout a lot flatter!\nIn doing this PR I've noticed that you are overriding layouts in layout-v21. This leads to duplicate layouts that are a pain to manage. You should consider switching to themes and overriding themes instead of layouts. This way you will only have one version of a layout."

That way you have multiple styles that you apply to a single layout.\nFor example: The reason why we need to override the layout is because of the ripple background attribute. Lets make some styles:\nIn style.xml\n    <style name=\"Submission\"/>\n\n    <style name=\"Submission.List\">\n        <item name=\">android:background=\">android:selectableItemBackground</item>\n    </style>\nIn values-v21/style.xml\n    <style name=\"Submission.List\">\n        <item name=\"android:background\">?android:selectableItemBackgroundBorderless</item>\n    </style>\nThen in submission_list.xml all you need is:\n...\n  <LinearLayout\n                        style=\"@style/Submission.List\"\n                        android:id=\"@+id/base2\"\n                        android:layout_width=\"match_parent\"\n                        android:layout_height=\"wrap_content\"\n                        android:maxHeight=\"82dp\"\n                        android:orientation=\"horizontal\"\n                        android:paddingBottom=\"4dp\"\n                        android:paddingLeft=\"16dp\"\n                        android:paddingRight=\"16dp\"\n                        android:paddingTop=\"8dp\">\n...\nSo in this case you only need one layout and the style is changed depending on the system version. I haven't tested this but I'm pretty sure it should work. Since you are refactoring layouts you might as well try this. It would definitely make your layout code easier to manage."

Before, there was a static ArrayList of submissions shared between different activities, but this led to issues of overwriting data (if another subreddit was opened on top of the previous one) and crashes if it had been removed from memory.\nThe new model is based on serializing and saving the submission lists to memory and creating the data again at run-time when it's needed, through a helper class called OfflineSubreddit. It supports multireddits with the saving prefix \"multi\", and works even if no internet connection is available.\nAlso included in this PR is tons of view flattening for the submission views, and tons of speed optimizations for a lag-free submission views. This improves the overall performance of Slide considerably, and leads to easier to read code.\nI also did lots of extraneous bug fixes and crash fixes, including adding a default crash handler on the main thread which will ask the user if they would like to enter offline mode if a connection to Reddit could not be established, or a message saying the request failed. This is not a final solution to the issue, but our future move to RXJava will hopefully be a better solution to this issue.\nThis also totally re-does the initial tutorial with more intuitive hints popups, and a simple personalization screen before entering the app.\nThere are lots of changes, so some things may be broken. I have been building off of it for about a week now and have not noticed any major issues yet, so I think it's an appropriate time to merge with Master.",

Maybe it would be good if this were merged into a separate branch?\nThis started off as a pull request to display tables, but this has since turned into much more of a refactor due to performance issues.\nIt looks like the scrolling performance of every list view can be fixed to reducing the nested Linear/Relative layouts in the xml. The diff in comment.xml is an example of this flattening, and it's really been the biggest factor in speeding up scrolling.\nMakeTextviewClickable has also been removed, since a new instance is created on every onBindViewHolder call which is really unnecessary and had some funny logic. In doing so I've ripped out and bunch of code of with the old references and replaced it with new code that may or may not work. The most complete example is in CommentAdapter.setViews.\nCurrent features are\n\nhorizontal scrolling code blocks\ntables\nstrikethrough\nordered lists\nnested lists\nincreased comment scrolling performance\n\nI aim to solve the following (at least) with this pull:\n\n#934 done\n#440 done\n#682 done\n#122 done\n#968\ncomment scrolling performance (mostly there)",

The significance of specifying the remote branch is that you don't have to think about if your local one is up to date, but if it is git rebase master works just as well.\nProvided there were no conflicts you're good to go, you can now git push --force\nIt's a bit confusing at first but gets better.

Here are the things that I know are pending :\n\nNot sure if this will be saved as part of google drive save. Didn't look into it.\nWill work only for comment pane and no subreddit tabs. Doing it for tabs is easy but is a lot of duplicated code if not done properly. I can do that if required.\n\nIt is working fine on my phone. I would appreciate if someone can try this onto their device.\nHaving said that, I am happy about the other ongoing work for conversion to objects and hence didn't spend time to do 1 and 2 as this should be replaced by that PR. So depending upon the progress of the other PR we can chose to ignore this for now also.\nMy aim was to have a dirty version.\nIf we decide we will go with this for now, then as this replaces does the following :\nAndroid -> Android Multi Reddit\nand this will be saved as a User subscription we might have to later on push an update which will remove all these from the user's sidebar when we have the object PR ready.\nLet me know how you guys feel about this."

Currently you have to clear cache to make it working.\n Use FileOutputStream or sqllite instead of SharedPrefs to avoid problems (Reference)\n Add sorting of subscription in the object as well\n Add a better handling for collections\n Add multireddits to MainActivity\n Testing, testing, testing. This changes a lot of underlying code and has therefore a high chance of breaking something\n Add a syncSubscriptionsOverwrite in MainActivity - NotificationAsync. This will allow an automatic subreddit sync. New subreddits will be then displayed at next startup. It wasn't possible before because it would have overwritten if the user deleted a sub. This is fixed now because that is stored in SubscriptionType.HIDDEN\n Write tests to confirm that everything is working like it should",

This will be visible with a progressbar in the notification panel. Caching from the main screen still shows as a dialog popup (to discourage user interaction while caching)\nManage history screen with the ability to remove cached versions of subreddits, and has autocache settings there too\nNew offline MainActivity, less items in the toolbar and the option for getting to the manage history screen\nOverride in NetworkUtils for forcing into offline mode (for spotty coverage or if you don't want to use mobile data)\nNew spinner on the toolbar in offline mode for selecting the cache time they would like to load\n\nStill needs some testing but should be good for general use or an alpha",

You shouldn't have needed to remove the style from the styles.xml; you only needed to remove the line inside the amber style theme--that was my mistake",

I'll test it as soon as it's pushed to Alpha and report back.\n\nthere isn't a single submission view that is entirely visible on screen (the screen contains either two or one partial submission views),\n\nWhen I rotate to H, I've noticed that there is almost never a single image showing in the view.  The only reason that I noticed this is because the target picture is often almost always off the screen by 50-80%, after rotation, making me need to scroll a bit before clicking on it.\nLooking at this closer, when there is an imgur image, the best I can get to show on the screen, when H, is about 90% of one post.   I'd say the slide header takes up 35-40% of the screen, then the picture is shown taking up the other 60-65% and the title text and various buttons are off the bottom of the screen.   If I scroll up, the slide header collapses to about 15-20% and even with a 1 line title, I don't see the full post.   The bottom button row is always clipped.   So, I conclude that my phone can never display a single full image post when H.\nI'm downloading an update now."

The only issue that exists with them is that if you open a submission (in comments) on Slide--then go to another device (not Slide) and upvote/downvote that submission from the other device--and then refresh the comments of that submission--the vote count will be correct along with the correct coloring. However, when you leave the submission's comments, the post won't have any indication it was voted on in the submission view until you refresh the submission view.\nNot sure if this is worth fixing given the likeliness of that situation happening--I mean, who has two devices open to the same post simultaneously?\nEdit 2: It feels hacky given the ActionStates AND checking for values in up, but this works.",

I've increased it to 750ms, but as this is shared between the views this may be too high therefore the issue may need a different fix.\nI've also changed so mLastClickTime is updated only when a click is registered. That way we can at least make sure the user can have at least a single click registered once every 750ms instead of always having his clicks ignored when clicking too fast.",

If the external storage is full, the system will install it on the internal storage. The user can also move your application between the two locations.\nIf you declare \"auto\", you indicate that your application may be installed on the external storage, but you don't have a preference of install location.

Use comment pane, open any post, slide from left edge, you will not go back, instead the drawer will be open. This is the intented behaviour and happens as both subs and posts are in the same activity.\nPersonally, as you said, I would like when one is in a post, when he slides from the edge, he should go back. But some might argue that doing that now, is taking away functionality. Some people might use the existing design, to go to subs from within a post.\nHence, I feel that 3 DrawerEdgeFactor is a good enough compromise which allows you to open the drawer , but if you want to go back, just slide from a little further.\nLet me know your thoughts.\nTLDR :  I agree with what you are saying, but my concern is taking away of functionality."

Changed it to pass the sub which fixes it.\nNow we use\npublic void unsubscribe(Subreddit subreddit) throws NetworkException { setSubscribed(subreddit, false); }",

This requires atleast 2 clicks and is a little hard on big phones.\nUpvoting and downvoting using toolbar is easy as one you don't have to navigate to any place + toolbar is at the bottom.\nVideo : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2EVJCKBc3Xk\nLet me know what you all think.",

I tried doing that, but it led to bad UX as the complete card(with the image) was being loaded again taking more time.\nThis is not ready for merge yet. but is ready for testing. I will clean up the code when I get time, but in the meantime, if anyone play around with it and see if there are any crashes, bugs, etc, that would be awesome.",

A month ago, some changes were made which resolved most of the issues.\nLatest thread is from 2 days ago : https://www.reddit.com/r/slideforreddit/comments/50ck12/slide_is_so_slow_now_a_days/\nThough I agree that many a times cache is large, etc is the cause and clearing cache, fixes the issue, but I personally feel some things in slide were slow.\nSo digging into it, I fixed a few issues.\nResults :\n-If you are using comment pane and I assume many people use it, then this loading a sub is 2x faster now. In other cases, there should be no effect.\n\nSorting. Sorting posts in a sub, is now 3-4x times faster, sometimes even 5x.\n\nWhen I say x times faster, it is that the number of network calls have reduced by x times and assuming network calls is the biggest factor in latency.",

In that case, I'm just removing it from the list.\nI tried to limit the scope of this PR so as not to introduce breaking changes, ie. keeping the AsyncTasks as is and doing the OkHttp calls synchronously in there, using same protocol as before, timeout values, etc. It would be great to consider an okHttp and RxJava for network calls in the future since it would simplify a lot of the stuff done here.\nTargets #2251",

Setting this to descendantFocusability=afterDescendants seems to clear the issue right up. I'm not exactly sure why it's being explicitly set to beforeDescendants here, but my change doesn't seem to have any adverse effect. With this change, I don't think we need to go through and implement a custom EditText class.\nReference\nCommit Notes:\n\nSet onWindowFocusChanged check back to if(hasFocus) instead of if(!hasFocus)\nExiting fullscreen mode on text entry fields should now properly re-enable status/nav bars\nFixed focus issue on \"Go to subreddit\" EditText element\nTested on Google Pixel running v7.1.1 (NMF26Q)",

I did some research and it appears that fullscreen immersive mode is supported as of version 4.4 (API level 19). Currently we do not have version checks around this feature, but it may be worth implementing them. Maybe we could do an API check wherever that EditText element is referenced and set it dynamically based on API level.\n\nAPI >= 19 would be descendantFocusability=afterDescendants (immersive mode available)\nAPI < 19 would be decendantFocusability=beforeDescendants (immersive mode unavailable)\n\nThat would hopefully solve the issue for versions below and above Kitkat. If the issue impacts Kitkat, we would either have to choose between supporting immersive mode on Kitkat or the EditText field behaving properly unless a workaround could be found that supports both features.\nHappy holidays!"

It is disabled by default. When the setting is enabled and the app is in multi window mode, only a single column for submissionview, gallery, search, and multireddits should appear. The setting should have no effect if the app is not in multi-window mode.\nThe reason this came up is I like to have dual columns in landscape mode. However, when using the app in multi-window mode, the app still considers itself in landscape mode (even if the phone is held in portrait). This happens because the width is greater than the height. This makes it hard to read the submissions as they are shown in dual column mode on a very small width. This setting should make it much easier to browse when using this configuration\nLet me know if you have any questions.",

Unfortunately don't know if your changes break these limits, but I know that JRAW has a master rate limit built into it (I figured serially downloading would ensure we don't break any limits on our side either). One way we could do this is to execute each as a separate pooled thread, but keeping track of all of those threads is pretty messy and that's why I opted to just have one master async thread. If you have any other suggestions on how to go about this, I'm open to any suggestions!"

Glad to see you around :)\nUnfortunately I have run into many more issues updating to API 26, and although this builds, it is an instant crash on all devices. I have done a lot of test fixes on my local repo, and am trying to get it to a building and running state asap. I may copy parts of this PR into my commit, but I believe your changes conflict with the current ones locally. Thank you for fixing the build part!\nThe main issue currently is GSON has Java 1.8 code that can't be converted down to 1.7, so I have downgraded to an older GSON version to fix that conflict. Additionally, it seems as if there are missing or conflicting AppCompat files that cause crashes, and I'm looking into a fix for that. N was a super easy upgrade, wasn't expecting O to break this much :/"

I do not believe there is an issue running unescapeHtml on a url that does not need it or already had it ran. The only issue is if that method has considerable overhead, which I also do not think it does for the benefit of always having URLs handled well.\n\nThe change got rid of the, what was essentially, duplicate Reddit.defaultShare method in exchange for using the LinkUtil.openExternally method. If there is a reason to not do this, let me know, but it seemed like the functionality was the same and internal links are still handled fine.\nAdditionally, copying text was moved out to a LinkUtil.copyUrl helper method to keep the logic consistent and unescape the html in the urls for copying.\nCustom tabs were also not always correctly unescaping the HTML. I moved the logic for opening a custom tab out to a LinkUtil.openCustomTab method and forced it to always unescape the HTML if a custom tab can be opened (prevents doing it twice if no custom tab can be opened)\n\nFinally, every commit is an opportunity to run \"optimize imports\", so I did.",

If they close the message, doing task switching (two presses on multitasking in Android N+) opens a new version of Slide, presumably because it has the inbox in recents along with another version of Slide in recents, and when the context is deleted after the user leaves the screen (don't know why this is happening, possibly a flag?) Android just starts Slide again with the default intent and now the user has two versions of Slide in recents. Might be a little confusing to visualize, to reproduce just open a message, swipe out, then multitask back to it. Haven't tested to see if this PR changes the behavior though!"

I think the issue may be stemming from FLAG_ACTIVITY_CLEAR_TASK, this Stackoverflow post does a pretty good job of describing what some of these flags mean in conjunction with each other. I think if we just use FLAG_NEW_TASK and also use OpenContent as a separate taskAffinity, we can get the behavior we are looking for, and if so I can look through the code to see why some internal links are opening as new tasks. Also we need to make opening messages not create a new task, and instead open on the base task stack"

In these, the old provider name (.MediaView) was being used. I renamed the provider to be the generic .provider name to appease TedBottomPicker\nIn testing this, I ran into some confusion on why there were multiple shareImage methods that seemed to vary only slightly and in confusing ways, with the MediaView#shareImage logic just straight up not working. The only shareImage method I could get to work was the one in AlbumPager. This one was the simplest and had the fewest dependencies. When I converted ALL shareImage methods to be this same method, they all worked consistently without an issue.\nI do not have answers for what special things those other methods were doing and why they were causing failures in sharing when using the FileUtil#getFileIntent method. I'm not ruling something out in how I wrote it, I'm just unsure.\nNow, this time I DID test:\n\nSharing links\nSharing images\nSharing from albums\nSharing from tumblr albums\nDownloading images (notifications still work)\nDownloading from albums / tumblr albums (notifications still work)\nDownloading gifs (notifications still work)\n\nPlease verify that me removing those other methods and consolidating them into a single method does not break any required logic. I am not sure about edge cases they could have been resolving.\nAdditionally, this Util package is getting out of hand. Looking for incorrect usage of static helper classes (my new ShareUtil class included) could be a project.\nEDIT: Yes I should have broken this into two commits. No it would not have fixed the depressingly large PR.",

I am just finished this and pushing RIGHT before I go somewhere but I'd like to get the implementation of the built-in BottomSheetHelper I wrote in your hands now.\nThe overarching question is, \"Does this seem like it can reduce complexity or raise it?\". I did not modify (too much) any implementation of the logic on the bottom sheets. I may have added some LongPress actions here and there, but I copy-and-pasted right out of the switch statements.\nIdeally, if you want to go with how this is implemented, I would want to go back through, move some common logic somewhere more common, and possible template-ify some of the more common BottomSheet types (e.g., the link sharing one that is used more than once). I also need to put back in the nice \"ontouch\" tinting. Right now there is no feedback when you press and I have no real clue why yet.\nThere is no need to read all of this since it won't be merged like this, but I would like your thoughts on the Helper class (uses a pseudo-builder-pattern) and how it is written in the code. A pro tip is to look at a single massive diff (where I ripped out the third part BottomSheet), since they are all like that anyway. I'll do my best to point out oddities. Otherwise just stare at the new files and the resource file changes.",

I'm just going to use a real one and handle stuff better in build. I think I really like the pattern since it still allows things to be very structured and you're in full control (even if it becomes a library). The sheets builds in the order the code calls the items too, so you can dynamically control the order of the items.\nI fixed the conflicts locally with a Rebase. I can push that up soon.\nYou can definitely mess with this and push whatever you see fit. The next hurdle is those templates so we don't have to keep making the same buttons over and over again all over the place. I am confident I made mistakes in ordering and logic too so comparing to the old code will be necessary when doing that."

            "bodyText": "Reddit issue\nThis adds a new flavor dimension for Android P support, since you can't install an APK targeting a preview build on a release api. If there's a better way, let me know. You can distribute P builds to beta testers now and it can't be used on other API versions, while the current stable version doesn't target P.\nThe build variants are now named:\n\napiStable{gplayFlavor}{buildType}\napiPreview{gplayFlavor}{buildType}\n\nIf you want to switch around the API dimension and Variant (gplay) dimension in the titles let me know (or you can push that up)\nThis also fixes two bugs:\n\nThe first was in AdBlocker, the domains were throwing an index out of bounds. I can't tell why, but switching the logic to a worker thread reading a text file (in accordance to the link above the logics post), resolved the crash. (This is the reason for the massive +++, since I used a raw text file with newlines). I promise you that I did NOT test if this broke ad blocker (do not know how). Only that it causes the app to not crash.\nAdditionally I fixed a condition in cross posting that felt misplaced. It checked if a value didn't exist on a JSON string and if it didn't, it tried to get a value from it. This would always throw a null pointer. I did NOT test if this broke cross post (do not know how), only that is no longer throws a null pointer\n\nResolving these bugs let the app run on Android P. I verified the P app runs on P and the stable app runs on P and release versions. Please also verify this personally.\nIn addition:\n\nI upgraded gradle to 4.5. This is mostly house keeping since I was touching so much for Android P anyway\nI switched all compile usages on dependencies to implementation since compile is deprecated. The new gradle will always yell at you about this\nI dropped the specific buildToolsVersion declaration from gradle. This no longer needs declared with the Android Plugin for Gradle 3.0.0+\nI'm hard pressed to remember what I changed in MainActivity that warranted the code cleanup action to run on it, but that's there too I guess?",

I explicitly cast the type because I can't fathom why this adapter would be used elsewhere. There are better patterns for this and if you can think of one easily added, let me know\nThe List (?) storng all the Submission data is cleared on forceRefresh, the view is pushed to the top, and the toolbar is forcibly shown. This prevents the user from scrolling into soon-to-be stale data on refresh\n\nIn this, I added a new method to the SubmissionDisplayer interface to make it easier. All implementations now have a method that lets the View know that the adapter was changed in someway from somewhere else. This is helpful when the changes happen outside of the adapter, but the view is still available (like a hacky MVP).\n\n\n\n\n\nI separated the commits in a functionality change and a cleanup change to make it easier to see what had to change",

I modified the check to see if getText is null before checking isEmpty as well as consolidated the code a bit.\nAs always, preview the two commits separately to see the functionality change without the cleanup in the way",

            "bodyText": "Partial fix on issue from Reddit\nWhen pressing the \"open in external browser\" button from the internal browser, the url is opened in the default link handler. On links like \"https://www.reddit.com/gold/about\", this will cause it to infinitely open back in the Slide app, since that's the default link handler, but that url can only be opened in a WebView.\nIn internal browsers, this is manageable. When Slide is set to open in an external browser, this would likely cause an infinite loop, locking the phone.\nThis fix only fixes the button in the internal browser now to get your opinion. I added an intent on a URL that will likely never be link handled. This guarantees the returned package is a browser, not another app (or Slide itself). This may not be desired behavior. I could convert it so if the package to be opened is Slide, we open in an external browser, otherwise, let it be link handled.\nWhatever we decide, I can try to convert to the other ways Slide opens urls, to fix the infinite loop\nHopefully any of that makes sense.",

Not every sub menu will be searchable since some of the individual settings don't make much sense without context. The general design is to add a 'Search' EditView to the main settings page and dynamically update the view beneath it depending on the text that is entered.\nSettings sub menus are having most of their functionality moved to a Fragment that accepts an Activity in its constructor. This allows the Fragment to be used by the sub menu Activity as well as by the Settings Activity.\nLayout xml files have also been split into a parent/child model. The android:id tags have also been deconflicted since this feature makes it possible to combine two different layouts that contain an element with the same id. Text that is not meant to be clicked has been given an android:tag=\"label\" attribute to prevent their parent ViewGroup from being removed. Without this, the pruning is overly aggressive and will remove matches that should be displayed to the user in the search results.",

This will let the user select any browser on their device to use to open links in Slide. This works on any API version.\nIf a user only has 1 browse, they will not see the option and Slide will continue how it normally does. If they have two, the default browser will be used as it does now until they set one discretely. If they delete their browser they set, it is handled in the LinkUtil.overridePackage method and will fall back to regular behavior.\nAdditionally, I made it so Intent.setPackage is only run when the package NEEDS overridden and not for every single intent. It only NEEDS it when Slide is the package to be opened or when overriding the browser. Otherwise, it will fallback to default behavior.\nThe layout for setting a browser type has changed. I moved it out to a RadioGroup and made the actual WebBrowser app selection a pop up. This is a hope of giving more context that these two items are linked.\nLet me know if you want anything extra explained",

We are dealing with a WebView so I let the API handle everything until that can be sorted / if we care enough to keep this feature\nThere is a bug that causes the FullscreenVideo activity to run onStop() twice, throwing a non-breaking exception. I do not know why but am looking into it. It does not seem to hurt the app\nRunning Slide with PiP on is SLOW. There's a lot of data rendering all at once. I'll keep experimenting to see what can be improved if anything. If it can't maybe we can dump it.\n\nNotes above are why I kept this minimal. I do not know how meaningful this feature is, who would use it instead of just passing off to YouTube, and if it's worth the pain points for implementation (ideally at some point we'd want to deal with the video better than a straight WebView)\nLet me know what you think. \"I don't like it\" is acceptable since it was not much effort to write any of this.",

I added an enum to ColorPreferences to hold all the int values per base-theme type. These values are used in both the Theme enum and the new themePairList list used to link theme resIds to themeType ints\nEntire blocks have been condensed into single for-loops around this new themePairList.

This caused me to wrote a method to remove any empty parameters from a url before trying to give it to the video plugin (this is the only place I use this method since most browsers probably do not need this).\nAdditionally, I:\n\nMoved the YouTube Slide package and class strings out to the donottranslate file to prevent mistypes (verified they still work!)\nMoved the attempt to open the Slide video plugin out to a helper method that returns a boolean if it (hopefully) succeeded.\nChanged the logic after the video plugin does NOT open to respect the user's settings for browsers to open a video (previously we only opened externally forcibly)\n\nThis change means anyone using Reader mode will be pushed into a view telling them to enable JavaScript (on YouTube at least) since Reader mode won't support this. I do not know how to handle this naturally (PLEASE WEIGH IN ON THIS COULD BREAK USERS)",

This did not resolve ALL issues but RTL looks fully usable now and Ice Cream Sandwich is not a disaster artist.\nI am PAINSTAKINGLY looking at all the layouts possible in LTR to make sure I did not break LTR modes but they all look fine still after some programatic fixes.\nA small list of what happened here:\n\nChanged usages of Gravity.RIGHT to Gravity.END (and LEFT to START if it existed)\nAdded some logic in CreateCardView to also handle END and START on top of LEFT and RIGHT to fully support both RTL and LTR\nAdded usages of START and END in layouts (left and right were not removed)\nAdded usages of LEFT and RIGHT in layouts (pre-API 17 hell)\nChanged usages of \"right\" on gravity in layouts to \"end\" (and left to start if it existed)\n\nAnd surprisingly that is it.\nI will run with this build for a while to make sure I'm not some pleb that messed up. It's up to @ccrama to decide if this is worth a merge.\nMake sure you ignore whitespace changes on the diff to cut it down by around 3000 lines.",

If there is something still hanging out let me know so I can remove it\nI replaced everything in the layout for the WikiPage with a single webView that just gets the HTML data from the API loaded into it\n\nI added a cover over the WebView that hides when the page finishes loading. This is to avoid a white flash before the styles are loaded in\n\n\nThe customCss is set on the Wiki activity statically then accessed from the WikiPage. This is the prevent every fragment from recreating it since it only needs created once per subreddit as it is now\n\nThis CSS only modifies the background color, font color, and idle link text to match the default themes\nThere is a commented out method that makes tables horizontally scrollable in the view but that conflicted with the ViewPager so I commented it out and added a TODO\n\n\nI redid the AsyncTask on the WikiPage because it was in the way too often. It's a static inner class now that does the same thing but \"safer\"\nI overrode loading Urls on the WikiPage WebView\n\nIf the link out of the WikiPage is to itself, it calls a listener up to the Wiki activity to select the correct fragment\nOtherwise is just tries to open it however it needs to via the app or externally based on the user's browser preferences\nIf it tries to open an embedded WikiPage that does not exist, I show a dialog matching Reddit's error for that situation",

Additionally debugging would be difficult for those without external storage phones\nIf you or someone out there with a phone with external storage could verify that remounting external storage during up-time of the phone doesn't cripple the services the app runs, with explicit attention given to the auto-caching feature, it'd be much more comfortable to accept as a change, but I think more analysis may need done to see how the app responds to that in order to prevent user issues increases because of this change."

            "bodyText": "Corrected issue where Wiki sub-pages would not open from links\nAllow table and code elements to be horizontally scrollable in WebView\nFixes issue #2816\nThis change makes it so subpages (e.g. \"recommended/books\") in Wikis are opened correctly when clicking a link within the HTML\nAdditionally this change reformats table and code elements in the HTML to allow them to overflow on the x-axis be scrollable. This is done by injecting some JS that determines if the user touched a table or code dependent element and disables the ViewPager paging in the native code until their pointers are released from the screen.\nPros: You can scroll table and code blocks appropriately. This means the entire WebView does not scroll off the x-axis requiring panning before paging. Additionally we do not have to reformat these elements which would lead to them being rendered in an unexpected or unreadable way.\nAdditionally the way I implemented this allows it to extend to any element easily (written for table and code was just dropped in last minute and works fine)\nCons: You absolutely cannot page the pager on these elements regardless if they are actually overflowing the view. That logic in the JS would be pretty annoying to write and maintain and I feel it is an edge case of a problem. In cases the entire WikiPage is a table or code block this would just entirely kill paging, but again I believe that to be an edge case. The biggest problem is if a user is unaware why it is happening.\nLet me know how you feel. and if you have any better ideas in your head for this.",

The app already tried to handle that, but it didn't do it properly and instead of actually returning the raw video url, it returned a html based gifdeliverynetwork.com page. I fixed that by actually requesting the .mp4/.webm url from the redgifs api if a gifdeliverynetwork.com redirection is detected.\nHow to reproduce: go to a nsfw subreddit that uses gfycat links, search for a link that has been posted before the migration (just sort by top -> all, works on most subs)",
