Users can still save to external storage via the SAF dialog, but actually this is discouraged as almost no devices have SD cards today. Much better to use cloud storage these days (e.g. Google Drive).\nIt should be noted that saving to email attachment is not supported any more either.\nNote also that restoring wallets didn't change, so you can still restore from all old locations, including Google Drive and SD cards. To change this is planned for a future PR.",
