## Integrating User Feedback to Enhance Software Quality and User Satisfaction in Mobile Application Development

This repository contains the replication packages for the first two studies of my master's thesis, focusing on mobile application development and utilizing user feedback to enhance software quality and user satisfaction. These replication packages include all the necessary code and datasets required to replicate and validate our research findings.

## Overview

The studies included in this repository are as follows:

1. **Study 1**: Investigating the relationship between code quality and user experience in mobile applications.
2. **Study 2**: Investigating the relationship between categories of issues in app reviews and software artifacts, code quality, and user experience.

The replication package for **Study 3** can be found [here](https://github.com/tdresearchgroup/Review-Pulse).
